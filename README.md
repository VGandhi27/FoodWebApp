## <p id="general_info">General Info</p>
The project's main aim is to develop a web-based application that will make it possible for the customer to order food using this app.
In this, we are also creating a food recommendation app that will substitute the manual ordering system with an automated one.

There is a separate module where each task that was identified as necessary to develop the Food Web App or Food Ordering WebApp successfully is presented and described in detail:
- This project aims to create two interfaces: Customer and Admin.
- User Interface- Used to create an interface where the Customer can place orders, publish reviews, etc.
- Admin Interface- Used to create an interface where the Admin can add, modify, and delete food products.
- It also provides good authentication so that the legitimate user can use this app.
- Backend using MongoDB

At present, only the frontend and Backend of the website have been developed, which consists of the landing, sign-in, sign-up, profile, cart, and product description pages.

## <p id="features_for_future">Features to implement in future:</p>
- Recommendation System using Unsupervised Learning
- Payment Gateway to be established.
