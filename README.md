## <p id="general_info">General Info</p>
The project's main aim is to develop a web-based application that will make it possible for the customer to order food using this app.

In this, we are also creating a food recommendation app that will substitute the manual ordering system  with an automated one.

There is a separate module where each task that was identified as necessary in order to develop the Food Web App or Food Ordering WebApp successfully is presented and described in detail
- This project aims to create two interfaces that are Customer, Admin
- User Interface- Used to create an interface where the Customer can place orders, review etc
- Admin Interface- Used to create an interface where the Admin can add the food products, modify them, delete the food product
- It also provides good authentication so that the legitimate user can use this app
- Backend using MongoDB

At present, only the frontend and Backend of the website have been developed, which consists of the landing page,sign-in and sign-up and profile and cart and product description page.

## <p id="features_for_future">Features to implement in future:</p>
